  |   The World's Least Realistic Pool Simulator!                           |

  |   Pool Panic frees billiards from the table and unleashes it into a     |
  |   world where everything from jungles and deserts to cities and         |
  |   swamps is a living pool game! You already know that sinking eight     |
  |   balls is the ultimate goal, but can you succeed while contending      |
  |   with monster balls chasing you, or ballerina balls leaping away       |
  |   from your well-aimed shots?                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Take on the role of the mischievous, and dare we say, oblivious cue   |
  |   ball in Pool Panic's unique world comprised of 100+ levels while      |
  |   enjoying the single-player campaign, or invite your friends to join   |
  |   you for a multiplayer panic.                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Single player campaign includes a large world with over 100 levels   |
  |   that span music festivals, mines, diners, the wild west, caverns,     |
  |   farms, and more!                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Local multiplayer for up to four players. Multiple control modes     |
  |   supported, including two players on a single Nintendo Switch, using   |
  |   a single Joy-Con controller per player.                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Panic Mode pits your pool skills against the clock, but don't        |
  |   forget that all the other balls are just as animated and alive as     |
  |   you, so different balls react differently to hits!                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Discover the unique characteristics of dozens of different balls     |
  |   and the strategies required to pot them, even as they use their       |
  |   unique skills to try and thwart your efforts.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Fight a swamp monster, light up a derelict lighthouse, battle a      |
  |   biker gang, puke on a pirate ship, flee zombieballs after raising     |
  |   the dead, foil a bank heist, even joust! Seriously, you can ride a    |
  |   horse ball and joust.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   -Express yourself! White cue balls such as yourself can use a         |
  |   little pizzazz, so enjoy trying on the 80+ different hats you're      |
  |   able to steal from other balls in the game.                           |
